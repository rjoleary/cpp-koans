# C++ Koans

Koans help you learn new features of a programming language and experience test
driven development. Each koan revolves around a single topic and contains many
failing tests. You goal is to replace all the `MISSING` keywords with the
correct expression to make the tests pass.

I wrote these koans during high school to quickly teach friends the C++ data
structures useful for programming contests. They are a bit out of dated with
the new C++11 and C++14 standards, but I will update them soon and hopefully
someone will find them fun!


## Testing

If you use g++, build the file with `g++ --std=c++11 vectors.cpp` and run with `./a.out`.

If you use Visual C++ Express, copy the `koans_common.hpp` and `vector.hpp` into a new project and run.
